# Angular Tour of Heroes
This best way to learn is to reorganise it and then teach it.

##This experiment gives an overview of AngularJs 2. 

It contains subjects such as :

1. Templates
2. Directives
3. Components
4. Multiple Components
5. Services
6. Routings
7. Http

These are the the core fundamentals of AngularJs 2. 

We can use built-in directives to show/hide elements and display lists of hero data. We can create a component to display hero details and another to show an array of heroes. We can use one-way data binding for read-only data. We can add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding. We can bind component methods to user events like key strokes and clicks. We can select a hero from a master list and edit that hero in the details view. We can format data with pipes. We can create a shared service to assemble our heroes. And we can use routing to navigate among different views and their components. 

This experiment covers a lot of ground at an introductory level but other experiment will take us in greater depth.
